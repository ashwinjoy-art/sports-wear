        1) Success Messages: To inform users when an operation (like submitting a form or saving data) has been successfully completed.
        2) Error Alerts: To notify users of an issue, such as a failed API request or validation error.
        3) Warnings or Info: To give important messages or updates, like system alerts or tips.]
